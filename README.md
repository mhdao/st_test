  ## Source Code Detail

Source code stored in **src/main** folder includes 2 classes
1. **Solution.java** is class that contain all classes.
  - Animal is parent of all classes, it is abstract class, **boolean canwalk** is default value true, mean the detaul all animal can walk. **void walk** method will say 'I am walking' if animal can walk and say 'I cannot walk' in opposite case
  - Bird is derivered from Animal, it is inherited canwalk from parent and also has new properites: **String word** supports bird to sing a word. **boolean canfly** can tell a bird can fly or not.
